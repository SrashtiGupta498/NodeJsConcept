In Node, Buffer is used to store and manage binary data. Pure JavaScript is great with Unicode-encoded strings, but it does not handle binary data very well.
It is not problematic when we perform an operation on data at the browser level but at the time of dealing with TCP stream and performing a read-write operation on the file system is required to deal with pure binary data.
