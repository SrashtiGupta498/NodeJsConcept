Event Driven ARCHITECTURE IN NODE JS
In Node js event driven architecture , i.e key part of it how to handle all task at once without blocking operations.
These makes application more flexible and responsive

what is event driven approach?
Event driven  is a design patter where application respond to change in state user input message or other programs.
Instead of program logic tied to specific event as they occur.
These makes application more flexible and responsive.

How event driven works in node js?
Node js inherently event driven.
It core relies on single threaded event loop which efficienlty manage async operation.
Events:-
It occur something clicking a button , reading the file , networking the request.
EventLoop:
Node js has central loop constantly monitor these events. 
Act as a traffic controller .
Callbacks:
when an event occur node js execute callback function.
This function contain the code that should run in specific events.
Non-blocking:
It means waiting for an event (reading a file) meanwhile handle another task.
Asynchronous:
Many opn in node js are async. For eg reading a file doesn't stop the rest of your program.node js callback function to be executed while the callback function executed when file is being read.

Key Component in node js event driven architecture.
eventEmitter Module
event emitter module is a core part of node js that provide a way to create and manage custom events.
Its how you build thing that can send and recieve event signal

events:
Event-driven programming is a way of writing code where you focus on creating events and deciding how your program should react to them. It's like setting up a system of notifications and responses
Benefits of event driven architecture
Scalabity
Async process and input/output operation
Modularity
Responsiveness
The event-driven architecture is a core principle of NodeJS, enabling asynchronous and non-blocking I/O operations,
efficient handling of concurrent requests, and scalable application development.
By understanding the concepts of events, event emitters, and the event loop, developers can harness the power of event-driven programming to build robust, responsive, and high-performance NodeJS applications.
